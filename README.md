# USA-NPN Phenology Observation Portal

This repository contains the front end [angular2](https://angular.io/) code for the USA-NPN phenology observation portal. The main purpose of this project is to guide a user through downloading USA-NPN phenology observations. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Auto deployment is set up through Teamcity. Run `npm run builddev` or `npm run buildprod` to build the project manually. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
